# UR5 pick and place implementation using ROS and Gazebo with object classification by color
This project consists of simulating a **pick and place application**, using the **UR5** robot, with the objective of **classifying objects by color**. 
The project was implemented using **ROS Melodic**, furthermore I have used some tools like **MoveIt** for robot motion planning and **GAZEBO** as a simulation software. **OpenCV** was employed for developing the vision algorithm used for object color classification. All the code related to robot motion was written in **Python**.

## How to use
---
### Prerequisites
Now, I'm going to present the tools in which it has been tested that this project works
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- ROS Melodic

 To obtain this version of ROS, you can follow the instructuions that are on the following link: https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu  
 I would recommend carying out the Desktop-Full install in order to obtain all the necessary tools.
- Python version == 2.7
- OpenCV version == 4.2.0.32
- Pynput version == 1.4

### Installation
First of all, you need to create your workspace and source it.  
I will assi,e that your workspace is created in $HOME/catkin_ws and the source space is at $HOME/catkin_ws/src.  
Now, to obtain the repository in your workspace, you need to run the following commands:
```
>> cd $HOME/catkin_ws/src
>> git clone https://github.com/JaviRG30/UR5_color_pick_and_place.gi
>> cd ..
>> catkin_make
>> source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
At this point, you have already obtained the project files in your workspace.

### Exectution
1) To launch the GAZEBO simulation, you have to execute the following command.
```
>> roslaunch ur5_gripper_moveit_config demo_gazebo.launch 
```
This command launches a file of MoveIt package that combines the UR5 robot model with the gripper model.


2) To run the program that classifies the objects by color, you need to run the following command.
```
>> rosrun ur5_simple_pick_and_place mov_fmpiec_colores.py 
```
When you run this command, the robot should start performing the pick and place, organizing the cubes by their colors


3) In addition, with rhis repository we can also run a manual mode, wich allows us to move the robot with various operating modes.
```
>> rosrun ur5_simple_pick_and_place manual_controller.py
```
