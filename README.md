# UR5 pick and place implementation using ROS and Gazebo with object classification by color
This project consists of simulating a **pick and place application**, using the **UR5** robot, with the objective of **classifying objects by color**. 
The project was implemented using **ROS Melodic**, furthermore I have used some tools like **MoveIt** for robot motion planning and **GAZEBO** as a simulation software. **OpenCV** was employed for developing the vision algorithm used for object color classification. All the code related to robot motion was written in **Python**.
